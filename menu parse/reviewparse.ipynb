       "\"i came here 4 times with a different set of family members and coworkers and friends all in one week. and it was absolutely great every single time. had leftovers for days. we ordered the cumin beef (freaking amazing, ordered everytime), spicy crispy chicken (unusually tasty), kung pao chicken (i wasnt a fan, but my father in law loved it and said it was the best he had), water boiling fish (soft spicy saucy fish, absolutely delicious, has a slow burn that i enjoyed very much, ordered everytime), house special fried rice (i've had better), sauteed spinach (i bit on the oily side, but i liked it) and egg plant in spicy garlic sauce (not a fan, but definitely better than other places). all in all, this is a tie with my other favourite chinese restaurant now. service is always great here. the jasmine tea has the right flavor and really helps to soothe the soul. the ambience and decor is a lot nicer than other asian establishments on bellaire. they automatically charge a 15% on parties of 4/5? i will continue to come back here! love this place!!\""
